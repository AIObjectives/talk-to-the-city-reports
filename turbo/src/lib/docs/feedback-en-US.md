The feedback node enables members of the public to provide feedback on the accuracy of claims. Once added to a report, an exclamation point is available in the info panel that appears when clicking on claims and bubbles in the graph.

When the exclamation point is clicked, the user then has the option to label the claim as miscategorized, inaccurate, or not belonging to the dataset.

This feature is still currently in development, so the only functioning option is labeling a claim as not belonging to the dataset, which then filters out the claim on next load.
