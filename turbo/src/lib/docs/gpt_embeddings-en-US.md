This node leverages the OpenAI API to generate embeddings from the specified `data` input. It is important to consider the potential high volume of data transmission, encompassing both uploads and downloads.

Post-generation, it is advisable to index the computed embeddings in a database or utilize indexing services such as Pinecone. To prevent redundant data downloads and to manage utilization effectively, users are advised to disable the "Save to GCS" option after the embeddings are secured and indexed.

The input data format is assumed to be an `array` with an `claim` entry.
