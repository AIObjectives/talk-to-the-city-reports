Multi Cluster Extraction extracts topics and subtopics from the given text. The `context limit` setting represents how many tokens are analyzed at a time (there are roughly 1.5 tokens per word).

For unguided extractions with the default prompt, use a smaller number like 10k. For precise prompts, where you guide the model on what to look for, you can use larger numbers.

The maximum context size is 120k tokens.
