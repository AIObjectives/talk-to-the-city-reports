I will give you a long list of comments extracted from different video interviews on the topic of "tell me about the weather in your city".

I want you to propose a way to break down the information contains in this comments into topics and subtopics of interests. 

Keep the topic and subtopic names very concise and use the short description to explain what the topic is about.

Return a JSON object of the form {
  "topics": [
    {
      "topicName:": string, 
      "topicShortDescription": string,
      "subtopics": [
        {
          "subtopicName": string,  
          "subtopicShortDescription": string, 
        },
        ...
      ]
    }, 
    ... 
  ]
}

Now here are the comment: "{comments}"
