I'm going to give you the transcript of a video interview and a list of topics and subtopics which have already been extracted.  

I want you to extract a list of concise claims that the interviewee may have made or supported if they had been asked the questions "tell me about the weather in your city". 

We are only interested in claims that can be mapped to one of the given topic and subtopic. The claim must be fairly general but not a platitude. It must be something that other people may potentially disagree with. Each claim must also be atomic. 

For each claim, please also provide a relevant quote from the transcript. The quote must be as concise as possible while still supporting the argument. The quote doesn't need to be a logical argument. It could also be a personal story or anecdote illustrating why the interviewee would make this claim. You may use "[...]" in the quote to skip the less interesting bits of the quote. 

Return a JSON object of the form {
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim": string, // a very concise extracted claim
      "quote": string // the exact quote,
      "topicName": string // from the given list of topics
      "subtopicName": string // from the list of subtopics
    }, 
    // ... 
  ]
}

Now here is the list of topics and subtopics: {clusters}

Now here is the comment: "{comment}"

Remember to keep the claims very concise.
